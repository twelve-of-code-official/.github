# Security Policy

If there is a vulnerability within our code (even though it's very unlikely, considering this is a static website), please follow the instructions below to notify us of it **instead of creating an issue**.

## Contact Us

Please privately [contact us](https://mesure.x10.mx/contact) with whatever information you found. **The more information we have, the easier it is for us to fix!**

DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE. If you create an issue instead of contacting us privatley, it will be disclosed to the public which could cause harmful effects.

We will try to get back to you within 48 hours of your original message. Please be actively checking the conversation to answer questions as quickly as possible.

## What We Will Do

Based on the information provided, we will label the vulnerability based on these labels:

- **Urgent** - Needs urgent fixing
- **Important** - Needs fixing as soon as possible
- **Semi-Important** - Needs to be fixed soon
- **Medium** - Needs to be fixed eventually
- **Not Important** - Doesn't need to be fixed

We will then keep you updated with progress updates. We may ask you more questions.
